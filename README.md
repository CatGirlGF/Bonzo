#### Acryllic case

The case is designed to be cut out of 3mm acryllic and uses a 1.5mm switchplate.<br/>
I used 4mm female to female m2 standoffs from this listing: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003106030065.html

#### 3D printable case WIP

This case has been printed fully and works, but the screwholes are too tight and have to be drilled.<br/> Updated case design with heat insrets and correct size holes at some point.
